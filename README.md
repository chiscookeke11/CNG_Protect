# CNG PROTECT

## Overview
The CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) sector faces safety challenges due to recent vehicular explosions, resulting in significant damages including loss of lives, destruction of vehicles, and damage to surrounding infrastructure. These incidents have reduced public trust in CNG-powered vehicles, which have otherwise emerged as a cost-effective alternative to petrol. 

**CNG PROTECT** is a blockchain and IoT-enabled system designed to monitor CNG tanks in vehicles, addressing potential issues like leaks, overfilling, and gas drainage to enhance safety, efficiency, and transparency in the CNG vehicle industry.

## Goals
- **Safety**: Early detection of potential hazards, preventing accidents.
- **Efficiency**: Optimize CNG vehicle operations through data analysis.
- **Transparency**: Secure, immutable data recording and transparent communication across the system.

## Key Components

### IoT Devices
1. **Sensors**: To measure pressure, temperature, and gas flow rate.
2. **Microcontroller**: Processes sensor data and transmits it to the blockchain.
3. **Communication Module**: Connects the device to the internet for real-time monitoring.

### Blockchain Platform
- **Decentralized Ledger**: Securely stores and verifies data.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automate data recording, trigger alerts, and facilitate vehicle communication.

### User Interface
1. **Mobile App**: Provides real-time data, alerts, and communication for individual users.
2. **Web Dashboard**: Allows fleet managers to monitor multiple vehicles and analyze data for informed decision-making.

## Functionality

### Real-time Monitoring
- Continuously tracks CNG tank conditions (e.g., pressure, temperature, gas flow rate) to ensure safe and efficient operation.

### Alert System
- Generates alerts for abnormal readings or potential hazards, ensuring immediate response to unsafe conditions.

### Secure Data Storage
- Stores and verifies data on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized access.

### Transparent Communication
- Facilitates secure communication between vehicles and relevant authorities, improving overall accountability and safety.

### Data Analysis
- Analyzes historical data to identify trends, optimize vehicle performance, and enhance safety protocols.

## Benefits
By combining IoT and blockchain technology, **CNG PROTECT** aims to:
- Improve the safety and reliability of CNG vehicles.
- Ensure data integrity and transparency.
- Optimize operational efficiency through actionable data insights.
